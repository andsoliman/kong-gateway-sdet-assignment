        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '24.13.0'  # Or your version
          cache: 'npm'  # Cache for speed

      # Step 3: Install Node.js dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci  # Use ci for clean install in CI

      # Step 4: Install Playwright browsers

        run: npx playwright install --with-deps  # Include deps for headless browser on Ubuntu

      # Step 5: Install and start Docker Compose in background

      # Step 7: Run Playwright tests

          path: playwright-report/  # Directory of reports
          retention-days: 30  # Keep for 30 days

      # Step 9: Teardown Docker (always, for cleanup)
