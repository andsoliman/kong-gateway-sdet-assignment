      # Step 2: Setup Node.js (version matching your local, e.g., 18.x)
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'  # Or your version
          cache: 'npm'  # Cache for speed

      # Step 3: Install Node.js dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci  # Use ci for clean install in CI

      # Step 4: Install Playwright browsers
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps  # Include deps for headless browser on Ubuntu

      # Step 5: Install and start Docker Compose in background
      - name: Install Docker Compose
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose

      - name: Start Docker Compose
        run: docker-compose up -d  # Start Kong Gateway

      # Step 6: Wait for Kong to be ready (optional but crucial to avoid race conditions)
      - name: Wait for Kong to be ready
        run: |
          timeout=60

          fi

      # Step 7: Run Playwright tests
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npx playwright test  # Run all tests

      # Step 8: Upload HTML report as artifact (always, even on failure)
      - name: Upload Playwright report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()  # Always, for debugging failures

          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/  # Directory of reports
          retention-days: 30  # Keep for 30 days

      # Step 9: Teardown Docker (always, for cleanup)
      - name: Teardown Docker Compose
        if: always()
        run: docker-compose down -v  # Remove volumes for cleanup
