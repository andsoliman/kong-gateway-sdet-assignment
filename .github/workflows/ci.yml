name: CI - Playwright Tests for Kong Gateway

# Triggers: Run on push to main, pull requests, or manually
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual triggering from GitHub UI

# Jobs: Define the jobs to run
jobs:
  test:
    # Runner: Use Ubuntu latest for compatibility with Docker and Node
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Services: Run Docker containers as services (better than manual up/down for CI)

    # Sequential steps
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code from the repo
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Updated version

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js (version matching your local, e.g., 18.x)
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'  # Or your version
          cache: 'npm'  # Cache for speed

      # Step 3: Install Node.js dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci  # Use ci for clean install in CI

      # Step 4: Install Playwright browsers
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps  # Include deps for headless browser on Ubuntu

      # Step 5: Wait for Kong service to be ready (crucial to avoid race conditions)
      - name: Wait for Kong to be ready

            exit 1
          fi

      # Step 6: Run Playwright tests
      - name: Run Playwright tests
